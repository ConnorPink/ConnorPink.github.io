						This program was made for the IT department at PRHC hospital as a
						tool to provide easy access to processes that are not available in
						Active Directory and take a long time to comeplete manually. The
						program is written in powershell and converted into a executable
						file. The program requires administrator privileges and prompts the
						user to login when launched. Through this the program can run the
						commands under the credentials of whatever user is desired.
